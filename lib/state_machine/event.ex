defmodule StateMachine.Event do
  @moduledoc """
  Event is a container for transitions. It is identified by name (atom) and can contain arbitrary number of transtitions.

  One important thing is that it's disallowed to have more than one unguarded transition from the state, since this
  would introduce a "non-determinism" (or rather just discard the latter transition). We loosely allow guarded transitions
  from the same state, but it doesn't guarantee anything: if guards always return true, we're back to where we were before.
